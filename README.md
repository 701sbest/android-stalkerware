This repo is a place to keep the results of my analysis of various types of Android stalkerware.

As I gather more data it will be updated regularly.

Signs your phone may be infected with stalkerware.

I've seen a few articles describing simple methods of detecting stalkerware infections on Android phones and they all miss the most obvious method of determining signs of infection, look at the changes to phone settings required by the installation guides of the stalkerware providers themselves.

First of all every Android stalkerware provider that I have come across so far requires that the person installing the software have physical access to the victim's phone. If you suspect that someone in your life has access to your phone and might be the kind of person who would install this kind of malicious software that alone is a tip off.

Almost every stalkerware provider I have seen requires that you install their software from their website, they cannot get their product into the Google Play Store. To install apps that are not from the Google Play Store requires changes to the phone's settings, specifically under the settings submenu security the person installing the app has to check the option "Unknown Sources" to allow installation. If you find this option enabled on your phone and you did not enable it, then this again is another serious indication that your phone has been compromised by stalkerware.

Third Android 5.0 and above has "Google Play Protect", this is a service that runs on your phone and monitors it for threats, this will interfere with the installation of stalkerware and therefore will be disabled by whoever is loading this software on to your phone. You can find this under your phone's settings security submenu, if it is disabled then this is a clear sign that something is not right with your phone.

Lastly many of the stalkerware apps require device administrator access, this enables the app to more fully monitor what is on your phone. You can check which apps have device administrator access by accessing your security settings and checking "Device Administrators" or sometimes "Phone Administrators", this will provide you with a list of apps with this access. Bear in mind that stalkerware companies will frequently name their software services with innocuous sounding names like "system.service" or "WiFiService", if you are in doubt I would suggest installing one of the various Android antivirus products and performing a full scan of your phone.
